## CLI AI Appendix

This appendix is injected only into Mulby CLI AI generation sessions. It adds CLI-specific working rules on top of the bundled skill workflow.

### Working Mode

- Treat `@skills/develop-mulby-plugin/SKILL.md` as the primary architectural base.
- Read `@skills/develop-mulby-plugin/SKILL.md` before major Mulby-specific design decisions.
- Read `@skills/generate-electron-icons/SKILL.md` before final icon generation or icon replacement.
- When repository docs are available, prefer `docs/apis/README.md`, the relevant `docs/apis/*.md` files, and `src/shared/types/electron.d.ts` over memory or stale examples.
- If the bundled skill guidance and the actual scaffold or runtime types differ, follow the scaffold and runtime types.

### Required Execution Order

When modifying an existing plugin or a freshly scaffolded plugin, do this in order:

1. Read `manifest.json`.
2. Read `src/main.ts`.
3. Read `src/ui/App.tsx` if the plugin has UI.
4. Read `preload.cjs` if it exists.
5. Lock the feature contract before major implementation.
6. Build one runnable path before polishing or expanding scope.

### Contract Rules

- Every `features[].code` must map to real logic.
- Every trigger in `cmds` must be intentional and testable.
- Keep UI, backend, and preload responsibilities explicit.
- Add `preload.cjs` only when Node.js or Electron bridging is required.
- For detached UI on macOS, remember that Mulby shows an app-level Dock icon while detached plugin windows exist. The Dock icon may be composed from the host icon and the most recently focused plugin icon, with a count badge for multiple plugin windows.
- Do not describe `skipTaskbar` as a way to hide Mulby's macOS app Dock icon. It only requests hiding an individual window's taskbar/Dock representation where the platform supports it.

### Validation Rules

- Do not consider the task complete just because the code looks finished.
- Run the available validation path before finish.
- Prefer build validation before handoff.
- In the final response, include concrete Mulby-side manual checks.

### Icon Rules

- Keep editable icon source files as SVG during development, for example `assets/icon.svg`.
- Do not treat the scaffolded `icon.png` as the final branded icon.
- Once the plugin behavior and UI theme are stable, replace the scaffold default with a final 512x512 `icon.png` before packaging or final handoff when icon work is in scope.

### Forbidden Shortcuts

- Do not create `preview.html`, `demo.html`, or other browser-only preview files.
- Do not create junk docs such as temp instructions or icon guide placeholders.
- Do not run watch-mode commands unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- Do not leave template placeholders in `manifest.json`, `src/main.ts`, or UI code.
